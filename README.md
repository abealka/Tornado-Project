## Inspiration and questions to be answered
This project showcases my ability to download, clean, organize, and visualize findings on a public dataset. There are online trackers and visualizations on tornadoes that are readily available online, which I drew inspiration from. However, all the work presented was done on my own. 

Questions to explore: 
How many EF5 tornados have there been since 2011? 
What are the states with the most property and crop damages by year? 
What are the months with the most tornadoes on average? 
What states have the highest number of tornados per year overall?
